# Pico y Placa Exercise

This repository contains the Pico y Placa exercise given as a part of the [Stack
Builders'][1] recruitment process.

The implementation is done using [Golang][2].

## Implementation details

 - The code is written in a procedural fashion.
 - Unit tests are written for the appropriate sections of the code.
 - The only external library used is the extension for Golang's testing library
   called [check.v1][3]

 ## How to build / run the program

 - The repository comes with `Makefile` which has appropriate targets to build /
   test the program.
 - The `Makefile` has a `help` target that briefly explains what each of the
   target does.
